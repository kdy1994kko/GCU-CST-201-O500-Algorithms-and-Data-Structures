Finding the Binary Representation of a Positive Decimal Integer:
Problem Definition:
•    The task is to convert a positive decimal integer A into its binary equivalent. 
The binary representation of a number consists of only the digits 0 and 1.
Pseudocode for the Algorithm:
•    Write pseudocode for the binary conversion algorithm. The pseudocode should describe 
how to divide the number by 2 and store the remainders to build the binary representation.

Binary Representation: How can the binary representation of numbers be used in 
various applications, such as computer science or digital systems? Could you 
optimize the algorithm in any way for very large numbers?

Function ConvertToBinary(A):
    # Check if the number is zero
    If A is 0:
        Return "0"  # Binary representation of 0 is "0"

    # Create an empty list to store binary digits
    Create an empty list called binaryDigits

    # Loop until the number becomes 0
    While A > 0:
        remainder = A % 2  # Get the remainder (either 0 or 1)
        Insert remainder at the beginning of binaryDigits  # Build binary from right to left
        A = A // 2  # Divide A by 2 using integer division to remove the last bit

    # Combine all digits into a single binary string
    Join all elements of binaryDigits into a string
    Return the resulting binary string
