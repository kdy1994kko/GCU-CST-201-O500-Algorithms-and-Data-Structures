function main():
    read integer n from user
    repeat 100 times:
        create array of size n with values 1 to n
        shuffle array

        for each sorting algorithm (selection, bubble, merge, quick):
            make a copy of the shuffled array
            sort using the algorithm
            record number of comparisons and data exchanges

        for improved sort:
            make a copy of the shuffled array
            sort using improved algorithm (e.g., Timsort or optimized merge)
            record number of comparisons and data exchanges

    for each algorithm:
        calculate average comparisons and average data exchanges
        print averages
